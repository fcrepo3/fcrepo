In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether in 
contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed 
the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  
The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above 
stated warranty fails of its essential purpose.

frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this 
Agreement will immediately terminate. 
11.  Integration.  This Agreement is the entire agreement 
between you and Sun relating to its subject matter.  It 
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written 
communications, proposals, representations and warranties

SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE TERMS
These supplemental license terms (&quot;Supplemental Terms&quot;) add 
to or modify the terms of the Binary Code License Agreement 
(collectively, the &quot;Agreement&quot;). Capitalized terms not 
defined in these Supplemental Terms shall have the same 
meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement. These 
Supplemental Terms shall supersede any inconsistent or 
conflicting terms in the Agreement, or in any license 
contained within the Software. 
1. Software Internal Use and Development License Grant. 
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, 
including, but not limited to Section 3 (Java(TM) Technology 
Restrictions) of these Supplemental Terms, Sun grants you a 
non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to 
reproduce internally and use internally the binary form of 
the Software, complete and unmodified, for the sole purpose 
of designing, developing and testing your Java applets and 
applications (&quot;Programs&quot;). 
2. License to Distribute Software.  In addition to the 
license granted in Section 1 (Software Internal Use and 
Development License Grant) of these Supplemental Terms, 
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, 
including but not limited to Section 3 (Java Technology 
Restrictions), Sun grants you a non-exclusive, 
non-transferable, limited license to reproduce and 
distribute the Software in binary form only, provided that 
you (i) distribute the Software complete and unmodified and 
only bundled as part of your Programs, (ii) do not 
distribute additional software intended to replace any 
component(s) of the Software, (iii) do not remove or alter 
any proprietary legends or notices contained in the 
Software, (iv) only distribute the Software subject to a 
license agreement that protects Sun's interests consistent 
with the terms contained in this Agreement, and (v) agree to 
defend and indemnify Sun and its licensors from and against 
any damages, costs, liabilities, settlement amounts and/or 
expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection 
with any claim, lawsuit or action by any third party that 
arises or results from the use or distribution of any and 
all Programs and/or Software. 
3. Java Technology Restrictions. You may not modify the Java 
Platform Interface (&quot;JPI&quot;, identified as classes contained 
within the &quot;java&quot; package or any subpackages of the &quot;java&quot; 
package), by creating additional classes within the JPI or 
otherwise causing the addition to or modification of the 
classes in the JPI.  In the event that you create an 
additional class and associated API(s) which (i) extends the 
functionality of the Java Platform, and (ii) is exposed to 
third party software developers for the purpose of 
developing additional software which invokes such additional 
API, you must promptly publish broadly an accurate 
specification for such API for free use by all developers. 
You may not create, or authorize your licensees to create 
additional classes, interfaces, or subpackages that are in 
any way identified as &quot;java&quot;, &quot;javax&quot;, &quot;sun&quot; or similar 
convention as specified by Sun in any naming convention 
designation. 
4. Trademarks and Logos. You acknowledge and agree as 
between you and Sun that Sun owns the SUN, SOLARIS, JAVA, 
JINI, FORTE, and iPLANET trademarks and all SUN, SOLARIS, 
JAVA, JINI, FORTE, and iPLANET-related trademarks, service 
marks, logos and other brand designations (&quot;Sun Marks&quot;), and 
you agree to comply with the Sun Trademark and Logo Usage 
Requirements currently located at 
http://www.sun.com/policies/trademarks. Any use you make of 
the Sun Marks inures to Sun's benefit. 
5. Source Code. Software may contain source code that is 
provided solely for reference purposes pursuant to the terms 
of this Agreement.  Source code may not be redistributed 
unless expressly provided for in this Agreement. 
6.  Termination for Infringement.  Either party may 
terminate this Agreement immediately should any Software 
become, or in either party's opinion be likely to become, 
the subject of a claim of infringement of any intellectual 
property right.
